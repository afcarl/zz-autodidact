This directory is for public Go tutorials, projects and experiments that are not expected to become standalone repositories. This enables the use of git for synchronization across units and ease of back up/restoration without a proliferation of tiny repos in my github namespace and without contortions when importing.

```
github.com/michaeldayreads/zz-autodidact/go/foo     // a directory in this repo
github.com/michaeldayreads/zz-foo                   // when imported
```

In instances where an experiment is promoted to a full package, the `zz-` can be removed. 

*NOTE* that the package name would be `foo`.
