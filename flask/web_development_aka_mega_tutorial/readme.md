Completing this tutorial on pythonanywhere.com, and using pa.com with multiple branches inside the 
{username}.pythonanywhere.com site so that its fast to switch between branches to see the small projects / ideas I am exploring.

pa.com permits [virtualenv](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Virtualenvs)

Though that suggests slower switching. Will test further and post information found here and on stackoverflow, since others may wish to get through the [Flask Mega Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) on pa.com without all the install Miguel requires. 

Caveat: this is an experiment - I am NOT all the way through this tutorial just yet!
